# Security-Policy

This file contains:
  - A security policy that I wrote that utilizes Cybersecurity fundementals for a hypothetical software company.   
  - A resentation that can be viewed on youtube which explains the concepts behind the Policy. 
  - Two coding examples of SQL Injection and Buffer Overload concepts and reports on both of the solutions. 
  - A Journal that explains concepts I learned from the class and things I will remember most about them.
